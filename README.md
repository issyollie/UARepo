# UARepo
## This is my repository for GG4257: Urban Analytics as a Toolkit for Sustainable Urban Development. 

## Accessing the Data 
The data for Assignment 1 can be accessed from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13wSOHnQqmqMQAJ4uYTk5HldfkwJNOs0b?usp=drive_link).
Instructions on creating the necessary app tokens for data pulled from an API are included in the .ipynb. Despite this, I have also included in the google drive screenshots of essential maps and graphs throughout the notebook to reduce the need to run all the code on your own computer. 

## Using Binder
I would encourage the use of [binder](https://mybinder.org/) as a way to run these scripts. The environmental file (as a .yml) can be found in the repository as well.
